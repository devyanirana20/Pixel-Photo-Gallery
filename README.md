Hello , Glad to see u here !!!
So this is a Photo Gallery WEB Page 

About :
Developed an external web API that integrates with the Vue.js framework to send GET requests for retrieving images shared via WhatsApp, 
and dynamically displays them on a user interface designed with HTML and CSS.
Messages sent to a TWILIO phone number are retrieved and converted into JSON format, including details such as the image URL, message ID
, and message body. These messages are stored in a list and displayed along with the accompanying text sent with the image. Only images 
received within the last 15 minutes are fetched and displayed.
